# Decide-For-Me

A simple decision decider that can run natively on Mac (see the [compiled releases](https://github.com/jmason86/Decide-For-Me/releases)) or on any OS with Python. 

Just enter in your choices separated by commas and hit the decide button. It will randomly select one of them and display it. Keep hitting the button if you don't like the choice. 

I do this all the time to figure out what I really want to do. Pretty sad to have a computer decide for me, but hey, why not?
